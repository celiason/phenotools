	STATELABELS
		1 blocky 'fine crystals' [In Grellet-Tinner (2000), this character (the second occurrence of ``3d. layer'' in his character matrix) was coded as blocky crystals present or absent in the third layer, which he coded as present only in Apteryx and Dinor- nis. Here, a EZ composed of blocky crystals character- izes the eggshell of tinamous, as well as that of Apteryx and dinornithids.],
		2 'poorly defined acicular wedges' 'well-defined tabular wedges' [In Grellet- Tinner (2000), this character (“1t. layer mammillae”) was coded as acicular for tinamous only, and thus was auta- pomorphic. The mammillae of Apteryx eggshell, however, share this feature with those of tinamous.],
		3 'wider than high' 'higher than wide',
		4 unbranched 'branched/forked',
		5 absent present [In Grellet- Tinner (2000), this character (ornamentation) was coded as polymorphic for Apteryx (i.e., present as lineari- tuberculate and absent). Eggshells from four eggs avail- able to us showed no evidence of ornamentation, so this character was coded here as absent for Apteryx.],
		6 'present (strong)' 'absent (weak)',
		7 absent present,
		8 'occluded with plugs' unoccluded 'covered by the RZ',
		9 'present (strong)' 'absent (weak)',
