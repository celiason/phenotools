		1 'Titanosaurid eggs' 'Other eggs',
		2 'long elliptical shape where there is a visible broadening of the egg toward one pole with a tapering toward the opposite pole, which still retains a very rounded aspect' 'definite oval shape in which the widening is located close to but not at one pole and where the tapering is obvious and results in a pointed shape at the other pole' 'subelliptical shape but in which the egg broadening although still off center is more medially located than that observed in character states (0 and 1). This egg has an overall oval shape' 'short and sub-elliptical with so little tapering that these eggs could appear nearly round, and where the egg broadening is medially located',
		3 'displaying some type of ornamentation' 'absence of ornamentation',
		4 nodular linearituberculate smooth 'rugose to slightly rugose' granulated,
		5 'straight and bifurcate once before reaching eggshell surface' 'angustiprismatic type of pore canals (synonymous to straight pore canals) my observations show that this eggshell displays an oblique pore canals (Fig. 7D) with a round aperture are common',
		6 'round aperture' 'slit-like aperture',
		7 acicular rhombohedric calcite crystals' 'short bladed calcite crystals' 'long bladed calcite crystals',
		8 absent present,
		9 absent present,
		10 absent amorphous 'blocky crystals'  porous,
		11 absent 'one-layered, prismatic' aprismatic,
