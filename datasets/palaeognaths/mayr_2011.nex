		STATELABELS
			1 present absent,
			2 no yes [This character was proposed as a syna- pomorphy of Pelecaniformes and Procellariiformes by Cracraft (1988, p. 349); see also Mayr (2003a).],
			3 absent vestigial 'well developed' [Because the keratinous parts of the beak are not preserved in the fossil, I scored this character as unknown for Morsoravis (contrary to Bertelli et al. 2010, who coded it as absent).],
			4 absent present [This character was proposed as a synapomorphy of Pelecaniformes and Procellariiformes by Cracraft (1988, p. 349); see also Mayr (2003a). Its absence in Rhynchotus rufescens (Tinamidae) is here considered autapomorphic for this taxon.],
			5 absent present [This character was proposed as a synapomorphy of the taxon (Trogoni- dae + Steatornithidae) by Mayr (2003b).],
			6 no yes [I corrected the erroneous scoring of this character by Mayr & Clarke (2003) for Gruidae, and coded it as present' for this taxon.],
			7 no yes [(see Cracraft, 1988; Mayr, 2003a).],
			8 absent present [In the fossil outgroup taxa the absence of this character has been inferred from the morphology of the praemaxilla.],
			9 no yes [(after Technau, 1936)],
			10 no yes [Bertelli et al. (2010) coded this character as unknown. However, I consider it unlikely that a rostral portion of this structure is broken, which is as fragile as any other portion of the septum orbitale (which is mostly preserved).],
			11 absent present [Remains of one unfused processus maxillopalatinus are preserved in the holotype, therefore I scored this character as absent for Morsoravis (Bertelli et al. 2010 coded it as unknown).],
			12 yes no [This character was coded as unknown for the Aegothelidae in which the lacrimalia are reduced.],
			13 absent present [This character was coded as unknown for the Aegothelidae in which the lacrimalia are reduced. See Mayr et al. (2003) concern- ing the presence of supraorbital processes in the Strigi- formes and Mayr (2002b) concerning their presence in fossil stem group representatives of the Psittaciformes.],
			14 no yes [This character was coded as unknown in taxa in which the ectethmoid is reduced.],
			15 absent present [Character description was modified from Mayr & Clarke (2003), where only a well-developed crista ventralis was scored. Ac- cordingly, this character was scored present in Cariamidae, Gaviidae, Phaethontidae, and Fregatidae, in addition to the taxa coded “1” by Mayr & Clarke (2003).],
			16 'absent or very small' 'present and well developed' [Cracraft (1988, p. 347) listed a palatinum which is ‘‘poorly de- veloped posteriorly’’ as a synapomorphy of Galloans- eres.],
			17 no yes [(Ericson, 1997, character 8). We consider the presence of this character in some Strigidae (e.g., Aegolius) to be derived within the taxon.],
			18 'present, variably developed' 'vestigial or absent' [See Mayr et al. (2003) concerning the presence of vomers in the Musophagidae.],
			19 yes no [This character was coded as unknown in taxa in which vomers are reduced/ absent.],
			20 yes no [This character was coded as unknown in taxa in which vomers are reduced/absent.],
			21 no yes [This character was coded as unknown in taxa in which vomers are reduced/ absent.],
			22 yes no [I corrected the erroneous scoring of this character by Mayr & Clarke (2003) for Hesperornithidae and coded it as absent' for this taxon.],
			23 present absent [Although homology of the bas- ipterygoid articulation of Galloanseres with that of other neornithine birds has been considered uncertain (Weber, 1993; see below), they are considered topolog- ically equivalent potential homologues in this analysis (see Clarke, 2002).],
			24 no yes [Weber (1993) found developmental differences between the basip- terygoid articulation of Galloanseres and that of other neornithine birds, distinguishing the basipterygoid ar- ticulation of Galloanseres as rostropterygoid articula- tion. However, as he did not include the Anhimidae in his study, we only coded the morphological differences between the basipterygoid processes of Galloanseres and those of other birds.],
			25 absent present [Based on the phylogeny of Livezey (1986), we consider the presence of this character in some marine Anatidae to be apomorphic for these taxa and accordingly coded the character.],
			26 no yes [This character was coded as two separate characters by Cracraft (1988), and Cracraft and Clarke (2001) but we agree with Ericson (1996) that it represents a single character complex.],
			27 absent present,
			28 yes no [(lateral osseous wall lacking)],
			29 'paired and lateral' 'paired and close to/adjacent on cranial midline or single anterior opening (tuba auditiva communis)' [(see Cracraft, 1988, 344f; Clarke, 2002, character 27).],

			34 absent present [The presence of a double- headed quadrate was proposed as a synapomorphy of Neognathae by Cracraft (1988, 345); see comments in Witmer (1990).],
			35 absent present,
			36 absent present [The dorsal margin of the caudal surface of the quadrate, which is exposed in the fossil, is not pierced by these foramina; therefore I scored this character as absent for Morsoravis (Bertelli et al. 2010 coded it as unknown).],
			37 absent present,
			38 no yes [In concordance with Ericson (1996) but contrary to Cracraft (1988), we consider these features to be part of a single character complex. Usually, the condylus lateralis has its greatest extension in rostro- caudal direction.],
			39 no yes [This character was proposed as a synapomorphy of the taxon (Trogonidae + Steatorni- thidae) by Mayr (2003b).],
			40 absent present [This character was proposed as a synapomorphy of palaeognathous birds by Parkes and Clark (1966). Its absence in Rhynchotus rufescens (Tinamidae) is here considered autapomorphic for this taxon.],
			41 present absent [The loss of a coronoid bone was proposed to be a synapomorphy of Neornithes relative to Ichthyornis (e.g., Cracraft, 1988, p. 344).],
			42 absent present,
			43 no yes,
			44 'not as follows' 'with long and strongly mediolaterally compressed processus retroarticularis' 'with narrow, dorsally upcurved processus retroarticularis' [Character description was modified from Mayr & Clarke (2003), where only the presence of a retroarticular process was scored. Character state 1 was coded present in Anatidae, Anhimidae, Phoenicopteridae, and Pteroclidae. Character state 2 was scored for Galliformes, Threskiornithidae, Re- curvirostridae, Rallidae, Gruidae, and Morsoravis],
			45 no yes [This character was listed as a synapomorphy of Galloanseres by Cracraft and Clarke (2001, character 41).],

			51 absent present,
			52 absent present,

			54 no yes [This character was proposed as a synapomorphy of Phoenicopteridae and Podicipedidae by Mayr (2004).],
			55 '18-19' '20-22' '23 or more' [This character was coded as ordered.],
			56 no yes [Ericson (1997, character 25) erroneously coded a notarium as present for Anatidae and Anhim- idae; in only very few Anatidae two or three thoracic vertebrae are (often incompletely) fused.],
			57 'at least part of series amphicoelous or opisthocoelous, i.e., with subround, central articular surfaces that lack the dorsoventral compression and saddle-shaped articular surface seen in heterocoelous vertebrae' 'series completely heterocoelous' [Scoring of this character differs from Bertelli et al. (2010) concerning Morsoravis, which has heterocoelous thoracic vertebrae. I further cor- rected the erroneous scoring of this character by Mayr & Clarke (2003) for Phalacrocoracidae, and coded it as absent' for this taxon.],
			58 no yes [I coded Psittaci- formes as polymorphic for this character, as pleurocoelous vertebrae occur in some stem group representatives (Hal- cyornithidae, see Mayr 2002).],
			59 no yes,
			60 absent present,
			61 yes no,
			62 no yes [Within the Strigiformes, this character is absent in Tyto.],
			63 'not as follows' 'abutting with an articular facet at the apex carinae of the carina sterni (fused with the apex carinae in Balae- nicipitidae and Fregatidae, see Mayr, 2003a)' [We consider the fusion of the furcula with the apex carinae in the Gruinae (absent in Balearica) to be non-homologous to this character.],
			64 no yes,
			65 present absent [I corrected the erroneous scoring of this character by Mayr & Clarke (2003) for Rheidae, and coded it as absent' for this taxon.],
			66 absent present [It is uncertain whether this foramen is homologous to the foramen nervi supracoracoidei. Within the Cuculidae, this char- acter is present in Coua.],
			67 no yes [Within the Rallidae, the character is present in Himantornis (Olson, 1973, fig. 2). Although present in many extant Cracidae and Phasi- anidae, this character is absent in stem group represen- tatives of the Galliformes (Mourer-Chauvir􏰅e, 1992) and has accordingly been coded as absent for this taxon.],
			68 no yes,
			69 absent present [In the Opistho- comidae the coracoids are fused to the sternum and thus this character could not be evaluated. Contrary to Ericson (1997), we found it to be absent in the Burhi- nidae. Within the Gruidae crossed sulci are present in Balearica but absent in the Gruinae.],
			70 absent present,
			71 '3-4' '5-6' '7-8' [This character was coded as ordered.],
			72 no yes,
			73 'with four notches/fenestrae' 'with two notches/fenestrae or without notches/fenestrae' [In some Falconidae (e.g., Microhierax caerulescens, see Jollie, 1977, p. 201) the notches are completely reduced which we here consider autapomor- phic for these taxa.],
			74 'present, not fused to ribs' 'present, fused to ribs' absent [The presence of fused uncinate processes was proposed as a synapo- morphy of Neornithes by Cracraft (1988, p. 344).],
			75 no yes [The humerus of extant Psittacidae resembles that of Columbidae and Pteroclidae. However, the derived state of this character, although present within crown group Psittaciformes, is not present in any parts of the stem lineage (Mayr, 2002b); thus, it was coded as absent.],
			76 no yes [This character is present in extant Psittacidae, but see Mayr (2002b) concerning its absence in fossil stem group representa- tives of the Psittaciformes.
