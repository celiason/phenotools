	STATELABELS
		1 present absent [The loss of the keel is derived for all ratites.],
		2 present absent [Cracraft (1974, pp. 503 and 506) took both the loss and reduction of the posterior lateral processes as being derived for all ratites. Only the presence/absence of the processes are recognized here as distinct character states. The complete loss of the posterior lateral processes in Casuarius, Dromaius, and Rhea is postulated to be derived.],
		3 'sulci meet at or near the mid line' 'sulci displaced laterally' [Cracraft (1974, p. 503) described laterally displaced sulci as the derived condition, but did not state explicitly which taxa display this condition. Bledsoe (1988, character 3) described the cranial margin as being concave cranially (Apteryx, Rhea), straight (Dinornithidae), and convex cranially (remaining ratites) and further recognized the articular coracoidal sulci (Bledsoes character 6) as having states (a) meeting or nearly meeting medially, and (b) restricted to the lateral margins. Bledsoe considered Apteryx, Rhea, and the dinornithids to have the derived condition. In this study only the lateral displacement of the sulci is described because the curvature of the cranial margin is largely related to the location of the coracoidal sulci. Apteryx, Rhea, and the Dinornithidae display the derived condition, although the displacement in Rhea is not as extreme as it is in the other taxa.],
		4 'extends laterally toward the base of the scapulocoracoid process' 'directed more strongly posteriorly' [The Tinamidae, Anhimidae, and Struthio are characterized by the primitive condition. In the derived condition found in Dromaius and Casuarius, the ventral lip of the sulci angles more posteriorly toward the midline of the body of the sternum (Mivart, 1877, pp. 25, 33, Figs. 1 9 and 27). Rhea, Apteryx, and the Dinornithidae cannot be scored for this condition because of the lateral displacement of the entire sulci (see character 3 above).],
		5 'moderate to highly curved' flattened [Bledsoe (1988, character 5) described this condition as four character-states: (a) highly curved, carnia present, (b) highly curved, low medial ridge present, (c) moderately curved, no distinct medial ridge, and (d) flattened. Character state (b) was unique to Rhea, (c) was described fo r Cas uarius, Dromaius, and Struthio, and (d) fo r Apteryx and the dinornithids. The presence or absence of a keel is described above (See character 1). Re garding the curvature of the sternum, it is either curved (ancestral) or flattened (derived) and only Apteryx and the Dinornithidae display a flattened sternum.],
		6 'much longer anteroposteriorlY than wide mediolaterally' 'essentially equal in width and length' [ledsoe (1988, character 1) coded unique proportions for Apteryx and Aepyornis whereas here Apteryx is coded as being the same as the other ratites, which display the derived condition.],
		7 present absent [The loss of the sternal manubrium is a synapomorphy for all of the ratites.],
		8 'not fused' fused [The fusion of the scapula and coracoid is derived for all ratites.],
		9 absent 'in the form of a ridge located anteriorly to the glenoid facet and compressed mediolaterally' 'very pronounced and knoblike, projects toward the glenoid facet' [This is an unordered character because the primitive condition is unknown. The fusion of the scapula and coracoid is unique to the ratites (see character 9), and thus the outgroups have no homologous condition to polarize this character. The process, absent in Cas uarius and Dromaiu, is in the form of a mediolaterally compressed ridge in Apteryx and the moas, and very knobhke and pronounced in Struthio and Rhea.],
		10 'oriented laterally' 'orIented dorsolaterally' [The dorsolateral orientation of the glenoid fa cet on the scapulocoracoid is derived for Struthio and Rhea.],
		11 'shorter than the ulna' 'at least one-third longer than the ulna' [This character combines characters 11 and 29 of Bledsoe (1988). In character 11 Bledsoe descrIbed the proportions of the humerus as being (a) slender, length moderate, (b) slender, length elongate, (c) stout, short, and (d) slender, short. Characters states (c) and (d) are unique fo r Casuarius and Dromaius, respectively, but essentlally the elements of both are short. Although the humerus of these two taxa is short, It IS at least one-third longer than the ulna. In character 29 Bledsoe deSCrIbed the lengths of the ulna-radius relative to the humerus as being (a) subequal, (b) ulna-radius longer than the humerus, and (c) humerus longer than 􀀨he ulna- 􀀧adlUs. For this latter character, state (c) inexplicably did not appear in Bledsoes data matrix, (a) was ancestral, and (b) was derived fo r all of the ratItes. The primitive condition is coded here as a humerus that is shorter than the ulna-radius, and all of the ratites display the derived condition. Because dmornithids cannot be scored for wing elements, characters 11-18 are coded as unknown.],
		12 'protrudes slightly medially, does not extend proximally to the level of the head of the humerus' ' knoblike with great medIal protrusion, extends proximally to the level or slightly beyond the humeral head' [Bledsoe (1988, character 14) described three character states: (a) head protrudes beyond tuberculum (tuberosity) , (b) sub equal, (c) tuberosity protrudes beyond head. Bledsoe indicated that Apteryx, Rhea, and Struthio have the tuberculum protruding beyond the head of the humerus and that Casuarius and Dromaius are subequal. Given the variation observed in the specimens exarruned for this study, Struth io, Rhea, Dromaius, Casuarius, and Apteryx are all coded as havmg the tuberosity more or less protruding to the level of the humeral head.],
		13 'greatly flares laterally from the base of the external tuberosity and tapers to a prominent ridge as it continues distally' 'slightly raIsed rIdge begmn:ng from the base of the external tuberosity' [Bledsoe (1988, character 18) descrIbed this character in terms of the absence or presence of a rIdge at the base of the pectoral crest, and described the ridge as being present in Apteryx, Struthlo, and Rhea. In this study, the reduction of the crest to a barely perceptible ridge is postulated as being derived for all ratites.],
		14 'strong proximal protrusion of the external margin relative to the internal margin, with both margins well rounded' 'proximal protrusion of the external margin reduced so as to be essentially level with the internal margin, and with both margins well rounded' 'proximal protrusion of both margins greatly reduced so that they are flattened' [Bledsoe (1988, character 30) described the carpal trochlea as (a) highly curved, (b) moderately curved, or (c) flattened. Rhea and Struthio were scored as primitive (a), Casuarius as moderately curved, and Apteryx and Dromaius as flattened. For the specimens examined here, Struthio and Rhea are distinguishable from the ancestral state and display an intermediate condition in which the external margin of the trochlea is greatly reduced relative to the level of the internal margin, and both margins are well rounded. Casuarius, Dromaius, and Apteryx are considered to have the derived condition in which the trochlea are so reduced as to appear flattened. This character is ordered 1 - 0-2.],
		15 present absent [The loss of this articulation is derived for Casuarius and Dromaius. Apteryx is coded as questionable because the articulation has been found present in some specimens and absent in others.],
		16 three one [Dromaius, Casuarius, and Apteryx are considered to display the derived condition.],
		17 deep shallow [Bledsoe (1988, character 12) described the sulcus as (a) deep, (b) shallow, and (c) absent. The Dromornithidae were the only taxon coded as lacking a sulcus. The condition in the Tinamidae (a shallow transverse ligamental sulcus) is here considered to be homologous to that of the ratites, which display the derived condition.],
		18 'well developed and pronounced' 'reduced to slightly raised surface' [Bledsoe (1988, character 1 9) described the epicondyle as (a) well developed, (b) moderately developed, and (c) highly reduced. Bledsoe considered Struthio to be well developed, Rhea to be moderately developed, and Casuarius, Dromaius, and Apteryx to be highly reduced. In this analysis the external epicondyle is taken to be greatly reduced and derived for all ratites. Because the humerus of ratites is so modified, and skeletons exhibit considerable variation in what might be recognized as an epicondyle, it is not always easy to partition variation into clear character-states.],
		19 broad narrow [The narrowing of the dorsal, posterior synsacrum is derived for all ratites except the Dinornithidae.],
		20 'approximately equal to each other in length' 'posterior portion longer than the anterior portion' 'anterior portion longer than the posterior portion' [Apparently Bledsoe (1 988, character 37) miscoded this character because the anterior portion is described as being more elongate in Rhea and Struthio; the posterior portions are clearly more elongate than the anterior portions (for Rhea, see Mivart, 1 877, p. 2, Fig. 2). Casuarius and Dromaius also display this derived condition (Mivart, 1877, pp. 1 6 and 27, Figs. 13 and 22). Apteryx and the dinornithids display the other derived condition in which the anterior portion is more elongate than the posterior portion (for the dinornithids, see Oliver, 1949; for Apteryx, Parker, 1891 , plate 18, Figs. 278-279) . The character is ordered 1-0-2.],
		21 'essentially the same height dorsoventrally and width mediolaterally, dorsal margin curved' 'narrows dorsoventrally and mediolaterally, tapering to a conical shape, dorsal margin flattened' [Bledsoe (1988, character 40) described this condition as the dorsoventral width of the postacetabular ilium: (a) narrow, (b) moderately wide, and (c) very wide. Character-state (a) was ascribed to Struthio and Rhea, (b) was unique for Apteryx, and (c) was described for Casuarius and Dromaius. On the basis of an examination of Hesperornis (Marsh, 1880, plate X, Fig. 2) and the relative proportions of the other outgroups, the condition in which the posterior ilium remains approximately the same height and width for its entire length is considered ancestral. The condition found in Rhea and Struthio in which the posterior ilium narrows in height and width, tapering to a conical shape, is derived.],
		22 absent 'ischium long, straIght and narrow, ending in a hammer-like expansion that fuses or abuts against the posterior end of the ilium' [In the outgroups, Apteryx, and the dinornithids the ischium is broad dorsoventrally for almost the entire length and the distal end is free (Cracraft, 1974, p. 504, Fig. 9; Oliver, 1 949, Figs. 90 and 1 04). In Struthio and Rhea the ischium fuses with the pubis (see character 23 below), and so are coded as (?) since this character does not apply to these taxa. The ischium of Dromaius and Casuarius is narrow dorsoventrally and the distal portion ends in a hammer-like expansion (Mivart, 1 877, Figs. 13 and 22).],
		23 'essentially equal in length to the ilium and unfused' 'elongated beyond the ilium and fused to the ischium' [Bledsoe (1988, character 38) described the caudal protrusion of the ilium, ischium, and pubis as (a) pubis and ischium extend beyond ilium, (b) pubis extends beyond ischium, which extends beyond ilium, (c) protrusion subequal, and (d) ischium protrudes beyond subequal pubis and ilium. Character-state (d) was unique to Aeypornis. Character-state (b) occurred in Rhea, Struthio, and the Dinornithidae, and character-state (c) was found in DromaillS and Casuarius. For this analysis, the elongation of the pubis beyond the ilium and fusion to the ischium is found to occur only in Struthio and Rhea. In the other ratites and the outgroups, the posterior extensions of the pubis, ilium, and ischium are essentially the same and they are unfused.],
		24 'not fused with the pubis' 'fused with the pubis to form a complete obturator foramen' [This is derived for Struthio and Rhea.],
		25 'processes separate and not broadened to fuse with each other, narrowly fused to anterior and posterior ilia' 'processes broadened and fuse with each other and with the ilia to form a ventral plate of bone' [The derived condition is found only In Dromaius and Casuarius (Mivart, 1877, Figs. 1 6 and 26)],
		26 absent present [A puboischial bar is present only in Struthio and Rhea. Bledsoe (1988, character 42) described this character as the dorsoventral width of publs and lschial bar; it appears Bledsoe is referring to the same character as a puboischial bar.],
		27 'broad with two ridges, the internal ridge proJectmg more posteriorly than the external' 'internal ridge gready reduced, external ridge with sharp process protruding proximally' 'internal ridge completely lost, external ridge knoblike at proximal end' [modified from Cracraft, 1974, pp. 502, 506-508 and from Bledsoe, 1 988, characters 66, 67, 68, and 73) . Cracraft (1974) described four character-states. Cracraft coded a broad hypotarsus with two ridges (internal being larger) as primitive, and both ridges being pronounced more posteriorly as an intermediate condition. Cracraft then recognized two derived states, one in which there is a reduction of the external ridge and consequent development toward a single ridge, and another being a single ridge located along the external side of the bone. The intermediate state united Apteryx with the Dinornithidae, the flrst derived state united Casuarius and Dromaius, and the second derived state united Rhea and Strnthio. Bledsoes character 66 described Aeypornis and the Dromornithidae as differing in the shape of the hypotarsus from the other ratites. Bledsoes character 67 was autapomorphic for the Dromornithidae, character 68 united all of the ratites excluding Aeypornis and the Dromornithidae), and character 73 united Stuthio, Rhea, Casuarius, and Dromaius. This analysis postulates Apteryx and the Dmormthldae to resemble the primitive condition, Casuarius and Dromaius to display an intermediate condition, and Rhea and Struthio to display a further derived condition. For the latter character-state, the complete loss of the internal ridge results in the hypo tarsus being located more laterally than in the other taxa where it remains near the midline. The character order is 0- 1 - 2.],
		28  'proximally extended beyond hypotarsus' 'essentially equal to the hypotarsus in proximal extension' [the derived condition occurs in all ratites],
		29 'external cotylar surface relatively flat, internal surface concave with sharp proxlmal protrusion on its medial margin' 'external cotylar surface slightly concave, internal surface deeply concave with concurrent loss of sharp proximal protrusion on the medial margin' 'external and internal cotylar surfaces concave and essentially equal in depth' [The intermediate condition occurs in Dromaius and Casuarius and the derived condition is found in the Dinornithidae, Strnthio, and Rhea. Apteryx shows the primitive condition. The character is ordered 0-1-2.],
		30 'shallow and broad proximally, flattens out distally' 'deep and narrow for the entire length' [A deep and narrow metatarsal groove on the tarsometatarsus is derived for Casuarius, Dromaius, Struthio, and Rhea.],
		31 'generally smooth, lacking significant ridges' 'sharp ridge present on external side running proximo distally' [The derived condition is found in Casuarius, Dromaius, Struthio, and Rhea.],
		32 'four present' 'loss of digit 1' [The loss of digit I is derived for Casuarius, Dromaius, Struthio, and Rhea.],
		33 'surface of anterior interarticular area and base of the crests wide' 'surface of the anterior interarticular area narrows as the base of the crests becomes mediolaterally compressed' 'surface of anterior interarticular area greatly reduced as the base of the crests becomes sharply compressed' [Cracraft (1974, pp. 502, 506-508, Fig. 7D-F) recognized only a difference between Rhea and Struthio and the other ratites. Bledsoe (1 988) saw variation in terms of three separate character descriptions: Character 51 . Mediolateral compression of cranial and lateral crests: (a) slight or no compression, (b) moderate compression, and (c) substantial compression. Character-state (b) was unique for the Dromornithidae and state (c) united Rhea and Stmthio. Character 52. Extent of cnemial crest and remaining articular surface in proximal view: (a) cnemial crest equal in extent to remaining articular surface, (b) cnemial crest less extensive than remaining articular surface, and (c) cnemial crest more extensive than remaining articular surface. Character-state (b) was described for dinornithids, Apteryx, and Aepyomis, and state (c) united Stmthio, Rhea. Casuarius, and Dromaius. Character 54. Lateral margin between lateral cnemial crest and lateral articular surface: (a) shallowly concave, and (b) deeply concave. The derived condition was restricted to Casuarius and Dromaius. In this analysis, reduction of the anterior interarticular surface and the development of a deeply concave lateral margin are considered to be due to the mediolateral constriction at the base of the cnemial crests. Apteryx and the dinornithids resemble the ancestral condition. Dromaius and Casuarius display an intermediate condition in which the mediolateral compression is not as extreme as it is in Strnthio and Rhea. The character is ordered 0-1-2.],
		34 'flat to slightly extended above level of interarticular surface' 'moderate to greatly extended beyond articular surface' [In describing the proximal extension of the internal cnemial crest, Bledsoe (1988, character 53) recognized three character states: (a) moderately beyond the articular surface, displayed by Apteryx and the dinornithids, (b) slightly beyond the articular surface, described for Rhea and Struthio, and (c) far beyond the articular surface, found in Dromaius and Casuarius. The ancestral character-state found in outgroups shows the internal cnemial crest flattened or only slightly extended above the level of the articular surface. Enough variation occurred among the specimens examined that the derived condition is best described as moderate to greatly extended above the articular surface (Cracraft, 1974, p. 501 , Fig. 7 A-C) and is found in all of the ratites and the Tinamidae.],
		35 present absent [The loss of the supratendinal bridge on the tibiotarsus is derived for Casuarius, Dromaius, Struthio, and Rhea.],
		36 'rounded along distal margin, anterior margin grades into the shaft smoothly (not undercut)' 'flattened along distal margin, anterior portion slightly undercut' 'ovoid along distal margin, anterior portion sharply undercut' [When Bledsoe (1988, character 61) described this, Bledsoe only recognized a difference between the primitive condition and the derived state occurring in Struthio and Rhea. Here a derived condition is also hypothesized to occur in Dromaius, Casuarius, and the dinornithids (character-state 1). The other derived condition (character-state 2) is postulated for Struthio and Rhea. Apteryx resembles the primitive condition. The character is ordered 1-0-2.],
		37 shallow deep [Bledsoe, 1988, character 63). The depression is presumed to be the groove for the peroneus profundus muscle, and a deep groove is derived for all ratites.],
		38 'essentially level or slightly projected anteriorly relative to external condyle' 'projects strongly anteriorly relative to external condyle' [The derived condition is found only in Apteryx and the dinornithids.],
		39 'slight depression near anterior margin' 'deep pit in anterior margin and a groove along the posterior margin' [The derived condition occurs in all ratites.],
		40 'narrow and does not undercut the condyles' 'widens and undercuts the condyles at the proximal margin, forming a slight ridge that distinguishes the articular surface from the fossa' [The derived condition is found in Dromaius, Casuarius, Struthio, and Rhea.],
		41 'rounded, smoothly grades into shaft' 'moderate lateral extension, sharply undercuts base of shaft' [Only Struthio and Rhea display the derived condition.],
		42 'extends proximally beyond the level of the trochanteric fossa (iliac facet)' 'crest essentially on the same level with the iliac facet' [Bledsoe (1988, character 44) recognized four character-states, but three of those four are each unique to Aepyornis, Struthio, and the dromornithids. Bledsoe described Struthio as having the trochanteric fossa extended greatly beyond the level of the trochanteric crest, whereas here this condition is considered to be homologous to that of Rhea, Casuarius, Dromaius, and Apteryx.],
		43 'curved sharply to form a lip that faces medially, surface highly concave' 'rounded edge, no lip present, surface flattened to slightly convex' [A similar condition was described by Bledsoe (1988, character 43) for the caudal margin of the proximal antitrochanteric articular surface: (a) highly concave, (b) moderately concave, (c) straight or nearly so. Bledsoe coded character-state (b) for Struthio and Rhea, and character-state (c) for Apteryx. In this study no distinction could be made between moderately concave and straight. The derived condition occurs in all of the ratites.],
		44 'essentially equal in size and in their distal extension relative to the internal condyle' 'greatly enlarged and project distally beyond level of internal condyle' [Bledsoe (1988, character 46) recognized three character-states: (a) sub equal distally, (b) lateral condyle extended slightly distally beyond medial condyle, and (c) lateral condyle extended distally far beyond medial condyle. Character-state (b) united dinornithids with Casuarius and Dromaius, and character-state (c) united Struthio and Rhea. The specimens examined exhibited so much variation that it is difficult to distinguish between Bledsoes character-states (b) and (c). Therefore, Struthio and Rhea are coded for the same derived condition as that in Dromaius, Casuarius, and the dinornithids.],
		45 'relatively sharp posterolateral margin, proximal margin essentially level with external condyle' 'rounded posterolateral margin, proximal margin essentially level with external condyle' 'rounded posterolateral margin, proximal margin not extended as far proximally as external condyle' [Cracraft (1974, pp. 498-499, 507, Fig. 3) recognized only one derived condition, which Cracraft described as occurring in Dromaius and Casuarius. Bledsoe (1988, character 48) partitioned the variation into two character-states: (a) lateral and fibular condyles extend distally about the same distance, (b) fibular condyle extends less distally (three-quarters or less) than the lateral condyle. Bledsoe coded Apteryx, Casuarius, Dromaius, and Rhea as displaying character-state (b). The dinornithids are considered here to have the same derived condition as Dromaius and Casuarius : a rounded (not sharp) posterolateral margin and a proximal margin level with the external condyle. Struthio and Rhea display a second derived condition in which the proximal margin of the external condyle extends proximally beyond the fibular condyle. Apteryx resembles the ancestral condition. The character order is 1-0-2.],
		46 'rounded along distal margin' 'flattened along distal margin' [Bledsoe (1988, character 50) recognized three character-states: (a) semicircular, (b) triangular or elliptical, and (c) flattened. Bledsoe considered the primitive condition (a) to occur in the dinornithids and Apteryx, the derived state (b) to occur in Dromaius and Casuarius, and state (c) to occur in Struthio and Rhea. Specimens examined in this study displayed no distinguishable difference between semicircular and triangular or elliptical, so only Rhea and Struthio were considered to display the derived condition.],
		47 'appears more rounded and projects more posteriorly' 'appears more elliptical and projects more proximally' [The derived condition is found in Casuarius and Dromaius.],
		48 'broad and shallow' 'narrow and deep' [The derived character-state is found to occur in Struthio and Rhea.],
		49 'posterior facet ovoid in shape' 'posterior facet triangular in shape' [The derived condition occurs in Rhea, Struthio, Apteryx, and the dinornithids.],
		50 'pit for the tibialis anticus deeply excavated and narrow mediolaterally' 'pit shallow and wide, cutting into the fibular condyle laterally' [The pit for the attachment for the tibialis anticus becomes shallow and widens so as to slightly excavate laterally into the fibular condyle. The derived condition is found in Dromaius and Casuarius.],
		51 'shallow, almost flat' 'very deep, extending anteriorly' [Struthio and Rhea display the derived condition.],
		52 absent present [The process is absent in the Tinamidae, Anhimidae, Megapodiidae, dinornithids, Apteryx and is present in Struthio, Rhea, Casuarius, and Dromaius.],
		53 'projects slightly anterolaterally just over the articulation with the quadrate' 'projects anterolaterally over at least two-thirds of the body of the quadrate' [The Anhimidae, Megapodiidae, and Tinamidae have a zygomatic process that just slightly projects anterolaterally over the articulation with the quadrate, and this condition is here postulated to be primitive. All the ratites have the derived condition.],
		54 'not divided, simple rodlike structure' 'divided into dorsal and ventral surfaces' [The primitive condition occurs in the outgroups, the Tinamidae, Struthio, Rhea, Casuarills, and Dromaius. The body of the pterygoid is found as a simple rodlike unit that articulates posteriorly with the quadrate and the basipterygoid processes and anteriorly with the vomer and the palatines. Variation in the shape of the articulating surfaces of these elements is autapomorphic for each taxon. In Apteryx and the dinornithids the pterygoid is divided anteriorly, forming dorsal and ventral surfaces. This saddle-shaped portion on the medial side of the bone is henceforth called the pterygoid fossa. The dorsal fork appears to be the main body of the pterygoid and homologous to the body of the pterygoid in the other paleognaths. This fork extends anteriorly and ankyloses to the dorsal surface of the vomer. The ventral fork is the unique structure and ankyloses with the palatine anterolaterally and extends anteriorly to ankylose to the ventral surface of the vomer. Parker (1891 , pp. 55-56) described the pterygoid of Apteryx as divided anteriorly into medial and lateral processes, with the medial process articulating with the lateral border of the vomer and the lateral process articulating with the dorsolateral border of the palatine. Jollie (1957, p. 420) and McDowell (1948, pp. 527- 528) also described the pterygoid in essentially the same manner. This divided pterygoid and the resultant pterygoid fossa are apparently not found in any other birds except perhaps the "Lithornithidae" (Houde, 1988, pp. 20, 47, Fig. 5).],
		55 shallow 'deep, rounded pit' [The fossa is shallow in the outgroups, Struthio, Rhea, Casuarius, and Dromaius. In Apteryx and the dinornithids the fossa is deeply marked, partially as a consequence of the posterior articulating surface having a strong ventral elevation.],
		56 'posterolateral margins of the basitemporal plate flattened or just slightly developed into mammillar tuberosities' 'posterolateral margins of the plate with well-developed mammillar tuberosities' [The tuberosities have been shown to occur at the junction of the basioccipital, exoccipital, and prootic bones (Parker, 1895, p. 384) in dinornithids and Apteryx. The tuberosities are poorly developed or absent in the outgroups and the other ratites.],
		57 absent 'present as a "large pocket" formed from the maxillopalatines with the anterior portion ankylosed to the dorsal surface of the posterior maxillary' 'present as a "large pocket" formed from the maxillopalatines, the anterior margin ankylosing with the posterior margin of the maxillary' 'greatly reduced to a "small pocket" that ankyloses anteriorly with the posterior maxillary' [The antrum is present in all ratites (except Rhea, see below) , but in different character-states. The antrum in all taxa (Parker, 1895, plate LXII, Figs. 59-63) is located on the dorsolateral surface of the maxillopalatine. The antrum consists of a "pocket," the floor of which is formed by the maxillopalatine, and is covered by a thin lamina of bone with a posterior opening. Pycraft (1 900, pp. 1 85 - 1 87) described the antrum as the interior half of the maxillopalatine having the outer and inner borders turned upward to meet in the middorsal line to form a long, thin-walled tunnel. McDowell (1948, pp. 527 -528) described the antrum as a dorsal arched lamina of the maxillopalatine joining the ventral lamina at its margins, forming hollow cones with posterior openings. In the dinornithids and Apteryx, the dorsal and ventral surfaces are entirely formed from maxillopalatine bone, but the anterior portion ankyloses to the dorsal surface of the posterior maxillary (character state 1) . In the dinornithids the posterior openings are wide, whereas in Apteryx the posterior openings are small foramina. In some Apteryx specimens the posterior foramina could not be found. The antrum of Dromaius and Casuarius also formed entirely from maxillopalatine bone, but ankyloses anteriorly with the maxillary (character-state 2) . Struthio has the antrum reduced to a small, essentially open, anterior portion ankylosing with the posterior maxillary (character-state 3). Rhea displays a structure similar to that in Struthio, but it is so reduced that the homologous condition is uncertain. For the purposes of this analysis, Rhea has been coded as questionable. The presence of an antrum is derived; in this analysis the polarity of the character transformatlOn beyond the primitive state is unordered.],
		58 'ossification of chamber relatively poorly developed' 'ossification of chamber well developed' [The third, posteriormost vestibule of the nasal cavity, when present, is the olfactory chamber (portmann, 1961, pp. 42-43). The Tinamidae, Anhirnidae, and Megapodiidae, and all ratites except Apteryx and the dinornithids have a chamber that 1S poorly ossified. In Apteryx and the dinornithids, the olfactory chamber is enlarged and fused to the ectethmoid complex (Parker, 1891 , pp. 48-50; 1895, p. 389). In Apteryx the chamber contains a complex of ossified turbinals, whereas in dinornithids the chamber is empty.],
