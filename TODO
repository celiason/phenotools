Misc:
 [ ] locate characters with absence plus 'present but variable' states - recode to two characters: 1) presence/absence of the feature and 2) values/states of the feature
 [ ] locate compound characters, consider whether to recode as separate characters
 
duplicated.nex:
this is tricky. in many cases, new characters may differ from original ones (e.g., 0-1-2 instead of 0-1, even though they are scoring the same thing. how can we deal with this?)
 [ ]  make it so the set(?) difference between species names is also returned (in find duplicates)
 [ ]  change name of function (maybe to get.duplicates? find.dup.chars? or something...)
 [ ]  maybe create a function merge.nex with a `what` argument (either taxa or characters)?
 [ ]  create a separate find duplicates function that returns a map of old-new characters for use with merge.nex
 [ ]  benchmark ability to automatically find duplicates
  this function needs some work. it should return the user input (e.g., which characters were suspected duplicates, for further use, maybe with the 'map' argument in duplicated.nex). also, it should maybe do something such as, if a newer character scoring differs but is more complete than an old one (i.e. covers all old taxa), then just drop the old character rather than try to merge the two characters.

buildnex:
 [ ]  try out a few more PDF extractions
 [ ]  work on problem with text between data matrix scorings/rows
 
subset.nex:
 [ ]  can't subset on file and taxlabel right now. need to fix this.

plot.nex:
 [ ]  it would be cool if the colors allowed for polymorphisms in plotting colors (maybe split tiles?)
 [ ]  function is giving a plotting error if you don't have character labels in the nexus file

merge.nex:
 [ ]   how handle missing state labels?

read.nex:
 [ ]  add ability to write character sets/partitions
 [ ]  code character polymorphisms somehow (maybe '0&1&2'? this would work with rayDISC function then)
 [ ]  there are problems importing and merging datasets with missing state or character labels
 [ ]  if polymorphisms coded differently - e.g., with [] versus () - make it the same upon export with write.nex

write.nex:
 [ ]  output a nexus object with some state, character labels NA
 [ ]  add ability to output character sets, partitions in NEXUS file

testing:
 [ ] need to add a bunch of checks to ensure format of file is kosher
 [ ] benchmark against Rnexml reading capabilities

someday/maybe:
 [ ]  add ability to work with NEXML files
 [ ]  add a more general function to prune matrix (e.g., remove invariant characters, duplicates, etc.)

 [x]  make a way to scrape text from PDF files? @project(someday/maybe)

 [-] reword (in basic english?) the livezey characters, other datasets? maybe make a function to do this? access google translate perhaps? @project(Misc)
 [-]   make able to work with phylogenetic trees? @project(someday/maybe)
 [x] should there be a certain class associated with this? like 'nex' (YES) or 'morph' (NO)?
 [x] missing data (?s) should be converted, maybe to NAs
 [x] include character states names
 [x] include character state labels
 [x] make concat script bring in state labels
 [x] identify possible duplicate characters with some symbol to pull out later
