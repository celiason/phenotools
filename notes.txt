## merging characters

so let's say you get a set of matched characters

then what?

maybe it looks like this:

```
		trait1	trait2
spp1		0		1
spp2		0		-
spp3		1		0
```

missing data for spp2, trait2 AND different order of states (0-1 versus 1-0)

this will probably need to be looked at one at a time, unfortunately

if it looks like they are one and the same, we can tag trait2 then 1) flip the numbers and 2) merge with trait1

## merging taxa

input something like this:

```
current name		new name
---					---
Anomalopteryx_spp	Anomalopteryx_didiformis
Apteryx_spp			Apteryx_australis
Apteryx_spp			Apteryx_owenii
Casuarius_spp		Casuarius_bennetti
```

than run through the file and merge scorings for these two taxa
final file will have:

Anomalopteryx_didiformis
Apteryx_australis
Apteryx_owenii
Casuarius_bennetti


PROBLEMS

1. store original character number from multiple datasets @done
2. have original source included in character description @done
3. sort data by names of characters (e.g., all Premax related characters)
4. identify putative duplicate character pairs (same scoring matrix)
5. find duplicates in concatenated dataset

5) maybe like this?

1. Character 1. Modified from Bourdon et al. 2009 trait 25. [worthy2012 char 1] -- unique id: worthy2012_01
2. Character 25. [bourdon2009 char 25] -- unique id: bourdon2009_25, take this from what's in the brackets, like /([a-z]+[0-9]+)\schar\s(\d{1,4})/ then new id would be $1_$2

then look both scorings side-by-side to see if they line up?
